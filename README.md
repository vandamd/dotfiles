# dotfiles

These are the dotfiles for my macOS and Arch machines.

## macOS
This has been created with the help of gretzky's [dotfiles](https://github.com/gretzky/dotfiles)!

### Installation
1. Give terminal full disk access in `System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access`.
2. Install via: 
```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vandamd/dotfiles/main/run.sh | sh
```  
This expands to run.sh which will fetch this repo and run the install script

## Arch
